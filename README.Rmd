Kim and Yu, A Mutation Profile for Top-k Patient Search Exploiting Gene-Ontology
and Orthogonal Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Bioinformatics, 2015,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv409

Kim and Yu recently published the above paper in which they develop a method
for creating a mutation-gene-ontology profile. As part of the overall procedure, 
they described (Section 2.3, *Gene Function Profile*):

> To reduce the term correlation, we use only the most specific terms, i.e. the leaf 
> node term after propagating the scores of the non-leaf terms down to the leaf node 
> terms. This approach also resolves the problem of evaluating genes annotated with 
> general term as the effect of the gene of function identification is spread out over 
> several leaf node terms.
