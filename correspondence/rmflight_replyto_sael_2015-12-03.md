Lee,

It doesn't really address my concerns, and in my mind begs the question of why do the propagation down in the first place. There is nothing in the manuscript (or the supplemental materials) that I see that suggests it is truly "necessary", no comparison to doing it without propagation down, and no comparison with using a defined subset such as a GOSlim.

I have added to my original analysis based on your below comments (attached PDF) to show potential problems with propagating back up to parents, and left a comment in Pubmed Commons with my concerns and links to the github repo.

Regards,

-Robert
