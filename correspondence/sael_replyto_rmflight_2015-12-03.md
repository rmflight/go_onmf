Dear Robert Flight,

Thank you for taking interest in the work.

We are familiar with the guidelines for using the GO terms and I understand your concerns regarding "propagating down" the GO terms. The assumption behind the scheme is that since GO is a DAG, if we propagate terms down to leaves for all the signatures we will in the end up with subset of significant leaf node terms that if we propagate back up (SI Algo 1) we will end up with the relevant GO terms that are affected by the mutations. The Supplementary Data file contains (Algo 1, FigS5, and FigS6) contains experiments regarding the process and assumption made.

I hope this addresses your concerns.

Thank you,
